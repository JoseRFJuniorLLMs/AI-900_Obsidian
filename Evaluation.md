[[ General Performance]]
This criterion evaluates the overall effectiveness and efficiency of a system or process. It encompasses a wide range of metrics such as speed, accuracy, reliability, and scalability. General performance looks at how well the system performs under various conditions and its ability to meet the general expectations of its users.

[[Specific_Domains]]
This refers to the evaluation within particular fields or areas of expertise. A system may perform well in general, but it is also crucial to assess its capabilities within specific domains where specialized knowledge or functionality is required. For instance, a healthcare application might be evaluated for its performance specifically in medical data processing, while an educational tool might be assessed for its effectiveness in teaching different subjects.

[[Retrieval_Capability]]
This criterion focuses on the systemâ€™s ability to retrieve and access information efficiently and accurately. It includes the evaluation of search algorithms, indexing methods, and the precision and recall rates of the retrieval process. Retrieval capability is crucial for systems that rely heavily on information access, such as databases, search engines, and content management systems.
