➤ [[Text_Embedding]]: The first step is to convert the text data (documents, queries, etc.) into high-dimensional vector representations using a pre-trained language model like BERT, GPT, or custom models. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text in a dense numerical form.  
  
➤ [[Vector Database]]: The text vectors are then stored in a specialized vector database, like SingleStore or Pinecone or Chroma DB. These databases are optimized for fast nearest neighbor search on high-dimensional vectors.  
  
➤ [[Nearest Neighbor Search]]: When a user submits a query, the query text is also converted into a vector using the same language model. The vector database then performs a nearest neighbor search to find the vectors (and their corresponding text) that are closest to the query vector in the high-dimensional space.  
  
The key advantage of this approach is that it can capture semantic similarities that may not be apparent from just matching keywords.  
  
But, combining semantic search with traditional full-text search creates a hybrid search approach that can be even more powerful and effective for LLM-powered applications than either method alone.  
  
A hybrid search approach leverages the strengths of both semantic search and full-text search, providing the best of both worlds.  
  
Hence, choose such a database that supports hybrid-search, super fast ingestion and quick retrieval.  
  
Well, SingleStore database supports hybrid-search with super fast ingestion from various sources and has a better integration with all your favorite AI frameworks such as[[LangChain]],[[LlamaIndex]], [[Haystack]], etc.  
  
So my point is, always choose hybrid-search over traditional or just semantic search for better results.
