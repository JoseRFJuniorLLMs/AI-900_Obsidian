But to make RAG work perfectly, here are some key points to consider:  
1. Quality of External Knowledge Source  
  
2. [[Embedding Mode]]l: The choice of the embedding model used for retrieving relevant documents.  
  
3. [[Chunking]] Size & Retrieval Strategy: Experiment with different chunk sizes to find the optimal length for context retrieval.  
  
4. [[Integration]] with Language Model: The way the retrieved information is integrated with the language model's generation process is crucial.  
  
5. [[Evaluation]] & Fine-tuning: Evaluating the performance of the RAG model on relevant datasets and tasks is important to identify areas for improvement.  
  
6.[[ Ethical Considerations]]: Ensure that the external knowledge source is unbiased and does not contain offensive or misleading information.  
  
7. [[Vector Database]]: Having a vector database that supports fast ingestion, retrieval performance, hybrid search is utmost important.  
  
8.[[ LLM models]]: Consider LLM models that are robust and fast enough to build your RAG application.
