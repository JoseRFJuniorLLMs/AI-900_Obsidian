Guardrails are a type of safety feature that can be used in software development to prevent or mitigate the impact
of certain types of errors. They are essentially checks or rules that are put in place to ensure that specific
conditions are met before allowing code to proceed.

Guardrails are often used in conjunction with unit tests to provide additional assurance about the correctness and
safety of the code. Here are some key points about guardrails:

1.  **Purpose**: The primary goal of using guardrails is to catch potential issues early on, preventing them from
turning into more serious problems later down the line.
2.  **Types**: There are several types of guardrails that can be used, including:
   - **Null checks**: These are used to ensure that a variable or parameter is not null before proceeding with its
use.
   - **Range checks**: These verify whether a value falls within a valid range.
   - **Type checks**: They ensure the correct type is being used for a variable or parameter.
3.  **Implementation**: Guardrails can be implemented in various ways, depending on the specific needs and
requirements of your project. Some common approaches include:
   - **Preconditions**: These are checks made at the beginning of a method to ensure that the parameters passed
meet certain criteria.
   - **Postconditions**: After executing a piece of code, postconditions check whether the expected result was
achieved.
4.  **Benefits**: Using guardrails in software development offers several benefits, including:
   - Improved safety and reliability: By catching errors early on, you can prevent them from causing more
significant problems later.
   - Increased efficiency: Guardrails can help reduce debugging time by identifying issues sooner.
   - Better code quality: Implementing guardrails encourages developers to think carefully about their code's
correctness and robustness.
