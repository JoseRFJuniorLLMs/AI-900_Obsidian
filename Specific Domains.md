This refers to the evaluation within particular fields or areas of expertise. A system may perform well in general, but it is also crucial to assess its capabilities within specific domains where specialized knowledge or functionality is required. For instance, a healthcare application might be evaluated for its performance specifically in medical data processing, while an educational tool might be assessed for its effectiveness in teaching different subjects.
